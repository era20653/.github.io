<h1 class="c1">Stop Right There!</h1>
<p class="c3">The content of this webpage is simply a joke. It is obviously bad to try to increase a person's weight to an unhealthy level. A person should not feel the need to change because everyone is perfect the way they are. If someone feels the need to lose weight and exercise more then all the power to them and I fully encourage them to do so. Dont be pressured by the perfect bodies of media and television. Just be happy.</p>
